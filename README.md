# Talentuum Web 

Basic web site based on https://github.com/Talentuum/website-static/ 

## 🚀 Quick start


1. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**

   ```sh
   gatsby develop
   ```

2. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).
